# Lab Report 1: Remote Access and File System
Hello everyone! This is a short tutorial that will go through the steps needed to be able to log into a course-sepecific account on ieng-6. It will have the exact steps I took, so make sure to follow along then try it on your own. 

## Step 1: Installing VS Code
The first thing you want to do is download Viurtual Studio Code on your computer. If you alreadyu have VS code downloaded or you are using your school's computer lab, then you can skip this step. I had to do this step because I got a new computer that didn't have VS code.
* First, I went to this link https://code.visualstudio.com/ and downloaded the version for windows. If you have an Apple Macbook, then downlaod the version for Apple. After it has installed, click allow to open it. 
* I personally like to have my VS code on my taskbar because I use it alot as a Computer Science student, so I pinned it to my taskbar. You can do the same by long pressing the icon after you open it and choosing "pin to taskbar." 

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
Now, we are ready to get remote access by logging into a remote computer over the internet.
* First, if you are using a Windows computer like I am, you will need to install git for Windows. To do so, you want to download git from this link: https://git-scm.com/download/win. I followed the steps on this website https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994. Basically, you open the terminal in VS code by clicking on "terminal" on the top strip and you need to open the command pallete by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + P. Then, type "select default profile" in the search bar, and choose Git Bash as your default. In your terminal, click on the arrow next to the plus sign on the top right. Choose "Git Bash" from the menu. Now, you will have Git Bash be your default terminal. If you have a Macbook, just choose "bash" from the menu as it is already there.
* Now, you want to use the ssh command to connect to your remote server. Type "ssh" + your specific course id. For this class, it will be "ssh" + "cs15lsp23" + the letters in your course specific account. To find those letters, you want to log into https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php and check the letters after "cse15lsp23" on the button under "Additional Accounts". I used the command "$ ssh cs15lsp23kl@ieng6.ucsd.edu" to connect to my specific account.
* Since it is the first time I logged into this server, it asked me to provide a passcode by stating the authenticity can't be established. I typed "yes" and typed in my password. You want to do the same thing because it is expected to get the message saying the authenticity can't be established because it is the first time you connect to that server. The computer doesn't know whether to trust your or not, in this case.
