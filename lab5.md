# Lab Report 5: Debugging and Reflection

## Part 2: Reflection
This quarter, I learned so many different command-line techniques that I had never explored before, most of them being from lab. For starters, something specific that stood out to me was when my tutor, Genevieve, first showed me how to log in to a remote web server, `ieng6`, using the `ssh` command. I then learned to create my own webserver by compiling and running the pre-coded files, `Server.java` and `StringServer.java` and connect to them using the `curl` command. Connecting to a webserver from my terminal was so interesting to me, that I used to get excited for lab because that meant more guided exploration in those topics. Moreover, something easy but cool that I learned from my lab partner was opening my terminal using a keyboard shortcut. I used to always open my terminal by going on the top bar in my computer and clicking on `Terminal` then clicking on `New Terminal`. However, now I just use the keyboard shortcut and type in ` control ` + ``` ` ```. Also, since I did lab report 3 about the command `grep`, I learned multiple ways of using it in my terminal, some of them being really cool like `grep -n -color`. That command did not only search for a `string` and print its line in the terminal, but it also pointed out its exact location by changing its color to red and displaying the line number on the left side. That modification made the `grep` command more efficient, and I learned about it from researching it in lab report 3. To conclude, these are just a few new things I learned that stood out to me, but over the course of last quarter, I developed new knowledge and skills for Java, terminal, bash, debuggers, etc.
