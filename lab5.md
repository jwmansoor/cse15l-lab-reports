# Lab Report 5: Debugging and Reflection

## Part 1: Debugging Scenario
Edstem Debugging Scenario: 


## Part 2: Reflection
This quarter, I learned so many different command-line techniques that I had never explored before, most of them being from lab. For starters, something specific that stood out to me was when my tutor, Genevieve, first showed me how to log in to a remote web server, `ieng6`, using the `ssh` command. I then learned to create my own webserver by compiling and running the pre-coded files, `Server.java` and `StringServer.java` and connect to them using the `curl` command. Connecting to a webserver from my terminal was so interesting to me, that I used to get excited for lab because that meant more guided exploration. Moreover, something cool I learned from my lab partner was opening my terminal using a keyboard shortcut. I used to always open my terminal by going on the top bar in my computer and clicking on `Terminal` then clicking on `New Terminal`. However, now I just use the keyboard shortcut and type in ` control ` + ``` ` ```. Also, since I did lab report 3 about the command `grep`, I learned multiple ways of using it, some of them being really cool like `grep --color`.
