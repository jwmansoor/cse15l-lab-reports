# Lab Report 3: Researching Commands 
For this lab report, I chose to research four command-line ways to use the command `grep.` I used [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to help me generate four different options using grep in the terminal. For each of my options, I gave examples from the files and directories in `./technical` as well as cited my sources. 

## Option 1: 
`grep -r "string" directory/`
