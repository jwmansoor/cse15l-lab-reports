# Lab Report 3: Researching Commands 
For this lab report, I chose to research four different ways to use the command `grep` in my terminal. I used [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix) to help me generate command-line options. The specific prompt I gave ChatGPT was "find different ways to use grep in my terminal."  It came up with a bunch of different options and I chose four of the most interesting/useful ones. For each of my options, I gave examples from the subdirectories and files in `./technical` as well as cited my sources.  

## The Basic `grep` Command: 
**`$ grep "string" file-name.txt`**
* The `grep` command takes two arguments: a `string` (that you want to search for), and a `file` (that you are searching in). It then looks for the specified `string` in the specified `file` and prints out all of the lines that contain that string right in the terminal.
    * ![Image](grepsc1.png)
    * For example, I used the `grep` command here to search for the string `good` in the file `./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt` by typing in `grep "good" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt`. It printed out all of the lines containing `"good"` in my terminal. Below are some modifications to this command that allow us to do different things with the `grep` command.

## Option 1: 
**`$ grep -r "string" directory-name/`**
* This command allows us to search recursively for a `string` in all of the files and subdirectories of a directory. This means that by adding the flag `-r` to the `grep` command, we are telling it to search for that `string` in the whole directory instead of a specific file. As a result, the file name along with the line containing that `string` gets printed out in the terminal. 
* This command can be very useful when we don't know what specific file to search in. 
       *Additionally, if we want to search in our current directory, we can also try `grep -r "string-name" *`

**Example 1:** 
```
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -r " love " ./DOCSEARCH

./docsearch/technical/government/About_LSC/Strategic_report.txt:we do not pursue state planning because we love planning. We don't

```
* ‚ù§Ô∏è This command is useful for cases like this, where we want to find all of the files that contain the string ` "love" ` inside the directory `./DOCSEARCH' 
* ‚ù§Ô∏è `grep -r` prints all of the file names that have `"love"` in them along the lines that contain `"love"` in those files. 

**Example 2:**
```
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -r "tofu" ./DOCSEARCH

./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          consumed in Hawaii: tofu, fried tofu, pressed tofu, green
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          soybeans, miso, soybean sprouts, tofu skin, soy
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          same was true for tofu intake from the SQ and the FFQ:
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          means of tofu intake for each ethnic group, as estimated
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          products, miso, tofu skin, Western vegetarian meats, and
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:        reported eating tofu more than once a week as compared with
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:        women who ate tofu less than once a month. In a study from

./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          soy foods commonly consumed in Hawaii: tofu, fried tofu,
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          pressed tofu, green soybeans, miso, soybean sprouts, tofu
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          same was true for tofu intake from the SQ and the FFQ:
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          means of tofu intake as estimated from the two dietary
./docsearch/technical/biomed/bcr285.txt:          products, miso, tofu skin, Western vegetarian meats, and

jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % 
```
* üç± In this example, the `grep -r` command is searching for the string `"tofu"` in all files of the directory `./DOCSEARCH` and printing the `filename + the line in which "tofu"` appears in. Apparently, there are two files that have `tofu` in them, `biomed/bcr285.txt` and `biomed/1471-2202-2-20.txt`. 
* üç± This is useful because I knew I had seen `tofu` somewhere in this directory, but I wasn't sure which file it was in. This version of the `grep` command allowed me to see exactly where `tofu` appears. I can see how important this command is when searching for a `string` in a large dataset directory. 


## Option 2: 
**`$ grep --color "string" file-name.txt`**
* When we add `--color` to the grep command and run it in our terminal, it prints out all of the lines containing the specified `string` in the specifed `file.txt` **AND colors that `string` red.**
* Source: [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix)

**Example 1:**

`$ grep --color "tumors" ./technical/biomed/bcr45.txt`

![Image](grep--color1.png)
* **Markdown doesn't have a built-in method for changing text colors, so I provided an image of the output in [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead of a `code-block`.**
*  In this example, `grep --color` searches for the string `tumors` in the file `bcr45.txt`, prints out the lines containing it, and changes the color of every string `tumors` to red. This is useful because it makes it easy to see where the `string` we are looking for is exactly located. It basically points out that `string` by changing its color to red. 
 
**Example 2:**

`$ grep --color "summer" ./technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020053.txt`
![Image](grep--color6.png)
* **Markdown doesn't have a built-in method for changing text colors, so I provided an image of the output in [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) instead of a `code-block`.**
* Since there is only one line that contains the string `summer` in this file, that line is printed out with `summer` in red. `grep --color` changes the color of the string `summer` to red to make it easier for us to find where it is on that line. This can be very useful when we have multiple lines that contain the `string` we are searching for because it makes it easier to see the exact occurance of it, such as our ouput in example 1.

## Option 3: 
**`$ grep -n "string" file-name.txt`**
* This command searches for the specified `string` in the `file`, and prints all of the lines that contain that `string` **AS WELL AS THE NUMBER of those LINES in the order of which they first appear.**
* This can be useful because it allows us to identify where a `string` is located easily by giving us the number of the line it appears in. So when we go back to the file, we know exactly which line it appears in and can go back to it.

```
* In this example, `grep -n` finds **and numbers** all of the lines that have the string `"tumor"` in them in this file. This is useful because if I go back to the file, I know exactly what lines to look for and it will be so much easier to find `tumor`. In other words, this command makes my life easier. :)

```
* Here, I tried looking for the prefix `"-pre"` in this file, and `grep -n` gave me all of the lines that have the words stating with ` pre` as well as their line number. Now, if I back to this file, then I can easily find the lines containing words that start with `pre` by looking up the number given to me. The flag `-n` makes the grep command even more useful and efficient. 

## Option 4: 
**`grep -c "string" file-name.txt`**
* This option of `grep` prints out the number of occurences of the `string` we are looking for in that file. This can be useful if we are trying to see how many times a `string` appears in the file. 
* Source: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)

**Example 1:**
``` 
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -c  "the" ./technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020043.txt
155
```
* In this example, I am searching for the number of times the word `"the"` appears in this file. As we can see,`"the"` appears 155 times in this file. 
* We can use this command to see whether or not a file contains a specific `string` easily. 

**Example 2:** 
```
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep -c  "hello" ./technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020043.txt
0
```
* Here, I searched for the number of times the word `"hello"` appears in this file. `grep -c` printed "0" because `hello` isn't anywhere in this file. If I want to check if a file contains a specific `string`, I can use this command to see how many times it appears. If the command returns 0, then I will know that the file doesn't contain that `string` obviously. 

## Some More Options:
**`grep '^character' file_name.txt`**
* This modification of `grep` searches for and prints all of the lines that start with the specified `character` in the file. There are many instances where this can be useful. 
* Source: [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)

**Example 1:**
```
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep ^B  ./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
Boarding the Flights
```
* Here, the command printed out the heading that starts with `"B"` because that is the only line starting with `"B"`.
* This is the only line that printed because the other lines in the file start with a space character, ` ` or a different character.  

**Example 2:**
```
jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Pro docsearch % grep ^U  ./technical/911report/chapter-1.txt
United Airlines Flight 175 
```
* In the same manner, this printed the heading starting with '"U"'. 

**`$ grep -v "string" file-name.txt`**
* This command will give us what's known as an invert output of `grep`, meaning it will print out all of the lines that don't contain the specified `string` in the file. This can be useful if we are trying to find a line that doesn't have the string we want.

* This command basically gave me the result of all of the lines in the file `bcr285.txt` that don't have the string `e` in them, and our result is empty lines that have nothing but space characters or titles/headings that don't contain '"e"' in them. 


## Combined Modifications
* Here are some combined modifications that I found interesting. 

**`grep -n --color " pre" ./technical/plos/journal.pbio.0020043.txt`**
![Image](grep--color4.png)
* This made my search for the prefix '" pre"' really efficient by displaying the lines along with their numbers and emphasizing the `string` we are looking for by changing its color to red. 

**`grep -r -n --color " love " ./DOCSEARCH`**
![Image](grep--color5.png)
* This combines three modifications and allows us to search for the string easily in the directory `./DOCSEARCH`.
